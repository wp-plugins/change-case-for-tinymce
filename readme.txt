Change Case adds buttons to change text case in the WordPress visual editor.

== Description ==

This plugin solves one of my greatest annoyances. Quickly changing the case of selected text. Back when I built sites in Dreamweaver I had an extension that added this function so I could click a button and change the case of text but when I started developing for WordPress there was no similar plugin. So I wrote one!

Based on a request I have added a fourth button to add Sentence Case as well. So if you have a large block of text with . ? or ! between sentences it will Cap only the first letter of each sentence.

There is an Options Page to enable or disable any of the buttons.

== Usage ==

Highlight the text to be changed. Click the Visual Editor button inside your post/page for the desired effect:

* **UC** - Changes selected text to all Uppercase.
* **lc** - Changes selected text to all lowercase.
* **Sc** - Changes selected text to all Sentence case.
* **Tc** - Changes selected text to all Title case.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use buttons in WordPress TinyMCE Visual Editor

== FAQ ==
